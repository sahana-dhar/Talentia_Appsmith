Talentia is built using Appsmith. Turn any datasource into an internal app in minutes. Appsmith lets you drag-and-drop components to build dashboards, write logic with JavaScript objects and connect to any API, database or GraphQL source.

Talentia is a web app designed to connect entertainers and agencies in a cohesive manner. Think of Talentia as your one stop shop for all; with the ability to search through thousands of actors and agents coming from a variety of agencies and leave reviews and ratings, Talentia is the future for streamlining the film industry.
